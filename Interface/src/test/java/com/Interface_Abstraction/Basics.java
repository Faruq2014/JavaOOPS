		An abstract class is a class that is declared with abstract keyword.
		An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation.
		An abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods. Some of them can be concrete methods
		A method defined abstract must always be redefined in the subclass,thus making overriding compulsory
		 OR either make subclass itself abstract.
		Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared with abstract keyword.
		There can be no object of an abstract class.That is, an abstract class can not be directly
		 instantiated with the new operator.
		An abstract class can have parametrized constructors and default constructor is always present
		 in an abstract class.
